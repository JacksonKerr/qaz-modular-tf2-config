QAZ's Modular CFG:


IMPORTANT: Before installing you MUST put -console in your tf2 launch options!
Tutorial here https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=1040-JWMT-2947

If your mumble overlay turns into a white block, also include -nod3d9ex in your launch options


This CFG allows switching between four graphics presets using console commands. As well as other features using the plugins provided 
(and listed below) allowing this config to go above all others becoming a jack of all trades and a master of, well... All. 
This config is a great tool for both basic and advanced users. It can be highly customized and edited, or just left as is.

Core Features:
Switch Graphics configs on the fly
Change Direct-X level from the main menu (Without relaunching the game)

Plugins:
I feel these plugins are a necessity and while I can't see and reason to disable them, instructions on how to do so can be found 
in the qaz_scripts/plugin_options file.<br><br><ul>
Advanced View-model Toggler
Cross-hair Switcher</i></li>
Automatic Rocket Jumping Bind</i></li>
Regen (Infinite&nbsp;health on private servers with regen command) </i></li>
Numpad Class Switcher</i></li>
Medic Radar (Shows Nearby Friendlies)
Loadout Switcher (Disabled by default)
